Brion, E., et al. (2007). "Adiabatic elimination in a lambda system." J PHYS A-MATH THEOR 40(5): 1033-1043.
	This paper deals with different ways to extract the effective two-dimensional lower level dynamics of a lambda system excited by off-resonant laser beams. We present a commonly used procedure for elimination of the upper level, and we show that it may lead to ambiguous results. To overcome this problem and better understand the applicability conditions of this scheme, we review two rigorous methods which allow us both to derive an unambiguous effective two-level Hamiltonian of the system and to quantify the accuracy of the approximation achieved: the first relies on the exact solution of the Schrodinger equation, while the second resorts to the Green's function formalism and the Feshbach projection operator technique.
